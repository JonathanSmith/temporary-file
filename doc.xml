  <clix:title>TEMPORARY-FILE - A Common Lisp library to create temporary files</clix:title>
  <clix:short-description>
    Portable operators to create temporary files.
  </clix:short-description>
  <blockquote>
    <clix:chapter name='abstract' title='Abstract'>
      <p>
        This Common Lisp library implements a portable way to generate
        files with unique names.
      </p>
      <p>
        This library does not directly address security issues.  The
        application that uses it needs to take additional measures if
        it is important that files created by one process cannot be
        accessed by other, unrelated processes.  This can be done by
        using the system dependent security mechanisms like default
        file permissions or access control lists.

  <clix:chapter name='Installation'>
    TEMPORARY-FILE is self contained and does not have any mandatory
    dependencies.  It interacts with the <a
    href='http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/'>Bordeaux
    Threads</a> portability library to lock the generation of file names.
  </clix:chapter>
  <clix:chapter name='Default temporary file directory'>
    By default, temporary files are created in a system specific
    directory that defaults based on operating system conventions.  On
    Unix and Unix-like systems, the directory <tt>/tmp/</tt> is used
    by default.  It can be overridden by setting the <tt>TMPDIR</tt>
    environment variable.  On Windows, the value of the environment
    variable <tt>TEMP</tt> is used.  If it is not set, temporary file
    creation will fail.
  </clix:chapter>
  <clix:chapter name='Overriding the temporary file directory'>
    The Lisp application can set the directory where temporary files
    are created by the way of the "TEMPORARY-FILES" logical pathname
    host:

<pre>(setf (logical-pathname-translations "TEMPORARY-FILES") '(("*.*.*" "/var/tmp/")))</pre>

    This would set the directory for temporary files to
    <tt>/var/tmp/</tt>.  For more information about logical pathnames,
    please refer to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node208.html#SECTION002715000000000000000">
